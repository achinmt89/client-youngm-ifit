Project to solve iFit exercise data problem

## Background
Client recently purchased a [NordicTrack s15i](https://www.nordictrackfitness.com.au/product/commercial-studio-bikes/104/nordictrack-commercial-s15i-studio-cycle/12624/details) exercise bike which comes with the [iFit](https://www.ifit.com/apps) application. The iFit app captures and stores data about each workout which can be accessed using a touchscreen on the bike (the touchscreen is essentially an Android tablet), but also via an app or by logging into a website. Workouts can be exported from the website in two different formats.

## Problem Statement

The problem to solve is to enable an import of all the iFit workout data into client's [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) account as that is where they currently aggregate all their health data. The two export formats ([TCX](https://medium.com/decathlontechnology/gpx-tcx-fit-how-to-choose-the-best-file-extension-for-sport-activity-transfer-403487337c04) and [CSV](https://www.bigcommerce.com.au/ecommerce-answers/what-csv-file-and-what-does-it-mean-my-ecommerce-business/)) are not identical and each contain unique information, so they need to be merged into a single dataset containing the full complement of workout data. Garmin Connect accepts the TCX format, so the merged dataset needs to be exported as a TCX file.

## Possible Solution

Ideally client would love either:
1. An app where they can choose a workout from iFit and it imports it into Garmin Connect; or 
2. Slightly less ambitious, but nevertheless really useful outcome, would be a program where the client can download the workout files, pass them to a program which merges them and provides a new file to be imported into Garmin Connect.  

The client found a GitHub repo where someone had developed `R` code which does the latter contain some good clues about what needs to be done. Copy of `iFit.R` code in the xx directory.

## Sample Data

Note data does NOT contain PII data and (subject to size) could be stored in GitHub. 

Sample workouts exported from iFit in `data` directory.
